Link to Preprint of paper submitted for Conference: http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11771

Goal: To denoise random gaussian noise applied on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset with the help of a convolutional autoencoder

Libraries Used: Tensorflow and Keras

Dataset details: MNIST handwritten digits dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of dimension 28,28,1(grayscale)

Result:
